# LinOps religion

Hey! Lina is back ‚ù§Ô∏è

The basis for the work of the project are such systems as:

- Google Cloud Platform
- Azure DevOps
- Telegram (–¥–∞, –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –µ—Å—Ç—å bot ü§ñ)

Technologies used in this project:

* Terraform
* Ansible
* Bash & PHP scripts

  Terraform is a tool from Hashicorp that helps you manage infrastructure declaratively. In this case, you do not have to manually create instances, networks, etc. in the console of your cloud provider; it is enough to write a configuration that will outline how you see your future infrastructure.
  Ansible is open source software that automates software delivery, configuration management, and application deployment.
  Docker is a software for automating the deployment and management of applications in containerized environments, an application containerizer.

### A bit of magic with Merlin VMs: ü™Ñ
The good wizard Merlin came to help my project. Yes, yes, it was he who created 3 managing Ansible servers for each workspace. (It's a joke...)
In order for me to manage these virtual servers during the CI / CD pipeline, Merlin VMs were created. They had the Azure Pipeline Agent installed.

~ Taking off his hat, he took a deep breath. All tests have been passed. Finally got some tea.

Let's take a closer look at Merlin virtual machines:

As you can see, each Merlin is assigned to his space. Connecting directly to 'dynamic' machines is done by creating an SSH connection.

### Telegram notifications

To implement the project, monitoring the implementation of tasks was vital. Therefore, a special 'LinOps' bot was created for the project, which, after passing the CI / CD stages, sends a notification to the group in a telegram.
